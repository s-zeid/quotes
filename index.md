* **This is stuff that for-profit corporations can't and won't do, because the return on the investment is not in the next quarter—it's in the next generation.  Forward-thinking investment is a key responsibility of government—sometimes, they need to be reminded.**  
  —Matt O'Dowd, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ACW7GVKCxs>

* The earth is only the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in a cradle forever.  
  —Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

* If it were a story it would be set on the seafront of a long beach. A beach without beginning and without end. The story of a man who walks along this shore and perhaps never meets anyone. His gaze lingers occasionally to look at some object or fragment brought from the sea. The footprints of a crab or a solitary seagull. I always take the sand, the sky, some clouds, the sea. Only the waves change, always the same and different, smaller. larger. Shorter. Longer.  
  —Ludovico Einaudi, _Le Onde_ booklet

* I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government behind you.  [...]  Somehow, we need to get beyond the “I’m right so I’m right to nuke you” ethics that dominates our time. That begins with one word: Shame.
     
  One word, and endless tears.  
  —[Lawrence Lessig, "Prosecutor as bully"](http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully), on the killing of Aaron Swartz

* The different sound each instrument possesses tells a story, evokes emotion and each plays a part to create a whole picture. Stories can be abstract but through music we can create a clear image in the listener's imagination. The musician feeds into this narrative as we're always giving the audience a part of our lives, our story, we are completely vulnerable.

* My friend, still seemingly perplexed, asked me, "So if it's not about genitals, what is it about trans women’s bodies that you find most attractive?"  
     
  I paused for a second to consider the question. Then I replied that it is almost always their eyes. When I look into them, **I see both endless strength and inconsolable sadness. I see someone who has overcome humiliation and abuses that would flatten the average person. I see a woman who was made to feel shame for her desires and yet had the courage to pursue them anyway. I see a woman who was forced against her will into boyhood, who held on to a dream that everybody in her life desperately tried to beat out of her, who refused to listen to the endless stream of people who told her that who she was and what she wanted was impossible.**  
  —Julia Serano, *Whipping Girl*, Chapter 16

* Here and elsewhere we shall not obtain the best insight into things until we actually see them growing from the beginning...  
  —Aristotle, *Politics*

* When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.  
  —C.S. Lewis

* My function is not to reassure people. I want to make them uncomfortable. To send them out of the place arguing and talking.  
  —Ewan MacColl, *The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music (1st ed.)* by Paul Du Noyer, p. 226

* **Sin lies only in hurting others unnecessarily. All other "sins" are invented nonsense.**  
  —Robert A. Heinlein

* That’s not bullshit; it’s re-purposed bovine waste.  
  —John Oliver, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_F5GxCwizc#t=9m30.9s>

* **You’ve planted seeds of fear and hate in all who would be free.**  
  **At harvest time, the fruit will be for you and not for me.**

* One time, this guy handed me a picture of him, he said, "Here’s a picture of me when I was younger."  Every picture is of you when you were younger.  "Here’s a picture of me when I’m older."  "You son-of-a-bitch! How’d you pull that off? Lemme see that camera... what’s it look like?"

* It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished.  
     
  **But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, "whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection," and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever.**  
  —John Adams, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams#Boston_Massacre>

  —/u/thekadar81, <https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/mmzd2/door_bells_are_now_part_of_it/c32c4x5>

* No one wants to die.  Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there.  And yet death is the destination we all share.  No one has ever escaped it.  And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.  It is Life’s change agent.  It clears out the old to make way for the new.  Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.  Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.  
     
  Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.  Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.  Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.  And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  Everything else is secondary.  
  —Steve Jobs, 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech

  —Monty Python

* The greatest risk is to risk nothing at all.  
  —Leo Buscaglia

* What they lose through the lack of an ongoing relationship seems to be so incredibly valuable to them, so their desire to keep it, or their feeling of loss when they are not able to preserve the interaction, is so extreme that it drives them to do things you would not normally expect people to do.  
  —Julian Assange, <http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-20120118?print=true>

* You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.  From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty.  You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch."  
  —Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell

* There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
